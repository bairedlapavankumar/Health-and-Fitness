        <h2>Read This Before Performing:</h2>
    <h3><ul>safety measures:</ul></h3>
    <li>Warm-up: Start with gentle movements to prepare your body.</li>
    <li>Alignment: Keep your body in proper alignment to prevent strain.</li>
    <li>Start slow: Begin with a few rounds and gradually increase.</li>
    <li>Listen to your body: Avoid pushing too hard and modify poses if needed.</li>
    <li>Modify as necessary: Use props or adjust poses to suit your abilities.</li>
    <li>Focus on breathing: Coordinate your breath with movements for relaxation.</li>
    <li>Stay hydrated: Drink water before and after practice.</li>
    <li>Cool down: End with gentle stretches to relax your muscles.</li>
    <li>Seek guidance: Practice under the supervision of a qualified instructor if you're new or have health concerns.</li><br>
    <h3><ul>Injuries Occur:</ul></h3>
    <li>Muscle strains: Stretching or pulling muscles too far.</li>
    <li>Joint pain: Pain in knees, wrists, or shoulders due to incorrect positioning.</li>
    <li>Back pain: Discomfort in the back from poor posture.</li>
    <li>Wrist strain: Stress on the wrists from certain poses.</li>
    <li>Neck and shoulder tension: Tightness or discomfort from holding these areas incorrectly.</li><br>

        <h2>Building the foundation to great posture</h2>
        <p>posture means: a position of the body, or the way in which someone holds the body when standing, sitting, or walking</p>
        <p>This week is about learning new poses and exercises and using them to develop what is called an “Awareness Routine.”
        </p><br>
        <p>Learn poses that will help you lengthen your spine and release any tension you may have built up over the last few years.</p><br>
        <h2>1: Do a posture check</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e1.png" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Stand against a wall to check your posture. You should have less than 2 inches between the wall and your neck and back. Keep this position in mind as you go throughout the rest of your day, checking in at every hour.   </p><br>
        <h3>How to do a posture check:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stand with the back of your head against the wall and place your heels 6 inches from the wall. Your shoulder blades and butt should be touching the wall.</li><br>
            <li>Measure the space between your neck and the wall, and the space between your lower back and the wall. There should be less than 2 inches between both spaces. A larger gap indicates impaired posture.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <h2>2: Do Child's Pose</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e2.png" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Do 5 minutes of Child's Pose, morning and night. Child's Pose helps lengthen and stretch the spine, which is used to slouching after years of bad posture. </p><br>
        <h3>How to do Child's Pose:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start on your hands and knees, with your knees as far as shoulders-width apart and big toes touching each other.</li><br>
            <li>Crawl forward on your hands and extend your arms straight out toward the front of the mat. You can also drape your arms on the floor alongside your body.</li><br>
            <li>Slowly start to drop your hips back to rest on your heels.</li><br>
            <li>Rest your forehead on the floor.</li><br>
            <li>Breathe here for 5-10 deep breaths.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <h2>3: Add Standing Forward Fold</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e3.png" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Start with 2 minutes of Child's Pose and then practice 30-second intervals of Standing Forward Fold for 4 minutes. This pose deeply stretches the hamstrings, stretches the hips, and can help release any tension in the neck and shoulders.  </p><br>
        <h3>How to do Standing Forward Fold:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with your feet hips-distance apart and bend at the knees to support your body.</li><br>
            <li>Exhale as you bend forward at the hips, lengthening the front of your torso.</li><br>
            <li>Bend your elbows and hold on to each elbow with the opposite hand. Let the crown of your head hang down. Press your heels into the floor as you lift your sit bones toward the ceiling.</li><br>
            <li>Pull your shoulders away from your ears and drop your head and neck.</li><br>
            <li>Lengthen your legs until you feel a stretch in the hamstring muscles. Work on engaging your quadriceps to help your hamstring muscles release.</li><br>
            <li>Release deeper into the pose with each exhalation. Let your head hang as you feel the tension roll out of your shoulders and neck.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <h2>4: Add Cat-Cow</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e4.mov" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Follow this stretch sequence in the morning and at night: Hold the active Child’s Pose for 1 minute and the Standing Forward Fold for 2 minutes. Then, do Cat-Cow for 5 minutes. This movement sequence will help increase spinal awareness, which is a large part of less-than-perfect posture</p><br>
        <h3>How to do Cat-Cow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start on all fours. Your wrists should be stacked under the elbows which are stacked under the shoulders. Keep your fingers spread against the ground for increased stability and keep your neck neutral.
            </li><br>
            <li>Begin the cat phase: As you exhale, tuck your tailbone under using your abdominal muscles to push your spine toward the ceiling, making the shape of a Halloween cat. Lengthen your neck and allow your head to reach toward your chest so that your ears come down by the biceps.</li><br>
            <li>On the out breathe, “swoop and scoop” the pelvis into the Cow position so that your belly is dropped toward the floor. Lift your chin and chest and gaze up toward the ceiling. Draw your shoulders away from your ears.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <h2>5: Add chest stretch</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e5.mov" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Hold active Child's Pose for 1 minute, Standing Forward Fold for 2 minutes, and Cat-Cow for 2 minutes. Add 2 minutes of a chest stretch. This is the inverse of how we normally sit at work, so it can help reverse poor alignment and ward off back pain. Do this morning and night.
        </p><br>
        <h3>How to do it:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by standing. If you have joint pain, sit on your butt with your legs stretched out in front of you.</li><br>
            <li>Reach your arms behind you and interlace your fingers below your lower back. If your arms don't reach, use a small towel or PVC pipe instead.</li><br>
            <li>Keep your head neutral and your eyes set straight ahead.</li><br>
            <li>Then, when you're ready, begin to lift your chest so that your entire trunk elongates toward the ceiling and reach your hands back toward the floor.</li><br>
            <li>Hold this pose for 5 breaths, then relax and repeat.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <h2>6: Add Standing Cat-Cow</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e6.mov" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Do 1 minute of active Child's Pose, 2 minutes of Cat-Cow, and 2 minutes of the chest-opening stretch. Then stand up and do 2 minutes of the Forward Fold before doing 2 minutes of Standing Cat-Cow.</p><br>
        <p>The point of Standing Cat-Cow is to differently activate the back and core muscles, and to help increase awareness of your back in relation to the rest of your body.</p><br>
        <h3>How to do Standing Cat-Cow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>With your legs hip-width apart and knees bent, place your hands either out in front of you or on your thighs for added balance.
            </li><br>
            <li>Keeping your legs static, begin the cat (upward) phase. Lengthen your neck and allow your head to reach toward your chest, maintaining alignment with the spine.</li><br>
            <li>On the out breathe, “swoop and scoop” the pelvis into Cow position.</li><br>
            <li>Hold each pose for 5 breaths and repeat.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <h2>7: Build your core</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e7.png" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Before you start your Awareness Routine, do 3 to 5 rounds of high plank (one round equals 10 breaths).</p><br>
        <p>The high plank requires awareness of the spinal position as well as engagement of the abdominal muscles, both of which are vital for encouraging posture corrections.</p><br>
        <h3>How to do high plank:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start in a pushup position, with your arms straight. Press back through your heels so that the backs of your legs are active, too.</li><br>
            <li>With your elbows underneath your shoulders, create space between your shoulders and ears so that there's a slight stretch. Make sure your chest isn't sinking and keep your shoulder blades back.</li><br>
            <li>Do 3-5 rounds of 10 breaths, counting your breaths.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <h2>8: Strengthen your back</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e8.png" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Today, end the Awareness Routine with 5 sets of Downward-Facing Dog (holding for 3 deep breaths).</p><br>
       <p>Downward-Facing Dog is useful for opening the anterior chest wall and shoulders that are so often rounded with excessive desk work.

       </p><br>
        <h3>How to do it:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin on all fours.</li><br>
            <li>Tuck your toes and lift your hips high, toward the ceiling.</li><br>
            <li>Reach your heels back toward the mat without allowing them to plank on the ground. Drop your head so that your neck is long.</li><br>
            <li>As you stay here, make sure that your wrist creases stay parallel to the front edge of the mat. To alleviate the pressure on your wrists, press into the knuckles of your forefinger and thumbs.</li><br>
            <li>Breathe here.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <h2>9: Loosen tight hips</h2>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSGzFckvg7Yk2v8exuY5c74neErN4fn_mhJtg&s" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Finish the Awareness Routine with 5 minutes doing Pigeon Pose. This pose helps loosen tight hips and releases tension in the back of the spine and glutes.</p><br>
        <h3>How to do Pigeon Pose:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin in Downward-Facing Dog.</li><br>
            <li>Step both feet together and bring your right knee forward between your hands so that your outer right leg is resting on the mat.</li><br>
            <li>Make sure your left hip is always pointing down toward the mat. If it begins opening up toward the ceiling, draw your right foot closer to your body.</li><br>
            <li>Stay here with your hands resting on your right leg or walk your hands out in front of you, allowing your torso to rest over your right knee. Hold here</li><br>
            <li>Breathe into any areas of tightness and tension for 3-5 breaths, or about 30 seconds.</li><br>
            <li>Then place your hands on the mat in front of you, tuck your left toes, and step your right foot back. You'll now be back in Downward-Facing Dog again.</li><br>
            <li>Step your left foot forward and repeat Pigeon on the left side.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <h2>10: Double up on core strength</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e10.mov" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Plan for a 20-minute workout today — including an extra minute of the Pigeon Pose, if your hips are tight. After you're done, do 10-12 reps of the side plank, hip up, and twists 3 times.</p><br>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e10.1.mov" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Strong abs will help support your back so that your back muscles aren't compensating for your body's efforts to maintain proper posture.</p><br>
        

        <h2>11: Start standing at work</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e11.png" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Move your laptop or computer to a standing desk or counter. You can also eat lunch and take conference calls or meetings standing up. Another option is to spend 15 minutes of every hour standing. </p><br>
        <p>If you don't have a standing desk or high counter in your office, stack books or a crate on top of your desk to add height.</p><br>

        <h2>12: Reduce stiffness in your lower back</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e12.mov" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>At night, spend 5 minutes doing the thoracic spine rotation exercise. This pose helps improve mobility in your torso and reduces stiffness in the mid-to-lower back.</p><br>
        <h3>How to do it:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start out lying on your right side with your fingers spread slightly.</li><br>
            <li>Place your left hand behind your head, but keep your right hand outstretched on the ground in front of you with your fingers spread.
            </li><br>
            <li>Rotate your left elbow to the sky while exhaling, stretching the front of your torso, and hold for one deep breath, in and out.</li><br>
            <li>Return to the starting position and repeat for 5–10 breaths.</li><br>
            <li>Switch arms and repeat.</li><br>
            
        </ol><br>

        <h2>13: Fire up your glutes</h2>
        <img src="/assets/ex3e13.mov" alt="ex" class="ex3">
        <p>Today is about counteracting inactive glutes. When your glutes shut down, it can impact your hips and lead to poor posture.</p><br>
        <p>So, set a phone alarm for every hour and every time the alarm goes off, do 30 seconds of isometric glute squeezes. (You can do these sitting in your seat too.) Hold this contraction for 10 seconds and then release. Repeat for 1 minute.</p><br>
        <p>These isometric squeezes will help ensure that your glute muscles are firing properly.</p><br>
