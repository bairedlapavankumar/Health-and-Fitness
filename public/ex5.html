        <img src="/assets/ex5e2.mov" alt="ex" class="ex5">

        <img src="/assets/ex5e3.mov" alt="ex" class="ex5">
        <p>A precursor to the squat, a bridge takes the pressure off your lower back but allows you to work the same muscles: your core, glutes, and hamstrings. Remember to go slow and stay controlled, and squeeze your glutes at top for maximum benefit.

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by lying with your back on your mat,
                knees bent with feet on the floor and palms facing down at your sides.</li><br>
            <li>As you inhale, push through your feet and raise
                your butt and back off the ground. At the top, your body should form a straight
                line between your knees and shoulders.</li><br>
            <li>Slowly lower back down to the ground and repeat
                10 reps for 3 sets total.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <img src="/assets/ex5e4.mov" alt="ex" class="ex5">

            <li>Keep your chest up and out, engage your abdominals, and shift your weight back into your heels as you push your hip back.</li><br>
            <li>Lower yourself into a squat until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel to the floor. Your knees should remain aligned over your second toe.</li><br>
            <li>Keep your chest out and core tight as you push through your heels to stand back up to your starting position. Squeeze your glutes at the top.</li><br>
            <li>Perform 10 to 15 reps. Work up to 3 sets.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

            <li>In the lunge position, twist your upper body to the right, then twist back to the center.</li><br>
            <li>Return right leg to starting position and lunge forward to repeat movement with the left leg.</li><br>
            <li>Perform 8 to 10 lunges on each leg. Work up to 3 sets.</li>
        </ol><br>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
